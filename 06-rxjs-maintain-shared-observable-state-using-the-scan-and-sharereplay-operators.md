## Summary

- The `scan()` is very useful in RxJS. It **allows you to maintain a running state over time.** In this lesson, we'll look at some of the state types scan can hold: transient or single source of truth, and how we can achieve each of them by combining it with the share operators.
- We'll also look at the differences between `share() / shareReplay(1) / shareReplay({bufferSize: 1, refCount: true})` and how to avoid memory leaks when using them.

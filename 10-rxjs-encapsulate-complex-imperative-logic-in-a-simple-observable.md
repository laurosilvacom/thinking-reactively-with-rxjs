## Summary

- **Two very important features** of the Observable primitive is that they can be **activated by subscribing to them and disposed off** when we are not interested in them anymore. All good observables **need to clean up after themselves when they are disposed off**.
- We took advantage of this when we wrote the observable that switches to showing the loader when the count is positive, and stops listening to it when the count is zero.
- In this lesson, we will learn **how to encapsulate all the complex imperative logic for showing and hiding the spinner**, inside a simple observable that can be plugged into any stream.

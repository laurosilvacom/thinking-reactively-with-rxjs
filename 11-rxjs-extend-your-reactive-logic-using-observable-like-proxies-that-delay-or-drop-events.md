## Summary

- **Our app is working!** But now our manager comes in and tells us that some tasks in our app are finishing very fast, so users are seeing a short glimpse of the spooner which makes the app look glitchy.
- **Our new requirement is to wait at least 2 seconds before showing the spinner.** So without introducing any complexity into our main observable, we will create a new intermediary stream that will be a proxy between the observable that immediately tells us when to show the spinner and the one that actual shows it. **This new proxy will delay the events accordingly.**

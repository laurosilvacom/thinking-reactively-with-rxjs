In this course, you will use RxJS to build a loading spinner in an app that meets the ever-changing requirements from a mock Product Manager.

You'll also learn how to implement a "Konami Code" style feature that listens for a correct sequence of keys to be typed in a set amount of time.

Follow the thought process that Rares uses as he breaks problems down into manageable pieces that remain flexible, and become more comfortable solving problems reactively.

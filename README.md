- In this course, **you will use RxJS to build a loading spinner in an app** that meets the ever-changing requirements from a mock Product Manager.
- You'll also learn how to **implement a "Konami Code" style feature** that listens for a correct sequence of keys to be typed in a set amount of time.
- Follow the thought process that Rares uses as he **breaks problems down into manageable pieces that remain flexible**, and become more comfortable solving problems reactively.

## Outcomes

- Learn RxJS Operators
- Creating observables
- Building operators
- Converting written requirements to code
- Reactive problem solving

## Prerequisites

- [Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-reactive-programming)
- [RxJS Beyond the Basics: Operators in Depth](https://egghead.io/courses/rxjs-beyond-the-basics-operators-in-depth)

## Important

- ðŸš§The code we will learn/write during the lesson is in: `src/lesson-code`.
- View [example deployment here](https://vigilant-visvesvaraya-945613.netlify.com). best viewed on a phone screen (`F12` in Chrome, then `CMD+SHIFT+M)`.

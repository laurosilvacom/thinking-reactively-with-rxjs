## Summary

- Our manager, unaware of how much our functional reactive approach has kept us delivering these features on time and bug-free, decides they **want a small new feature added to the spinner before the next release:** **a percentage indicator**, showing how many tasks have finished out of the total started since the spinner was last shown.
- So in this lesson we will be looking at **combining the existing observables that gives the up to date count of tasks**, together with a more advanced use of the scan operator, to create a stream that tells us the total count of tasks that have been launched since the spinner was last shown, and how many of them have completed.
- Weâ€™ll also take advantage of scanâ€™s disposal behavior to reset its state when the spinner hides.
